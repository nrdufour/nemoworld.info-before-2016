title: LHC and... rap!

Here is as a fun video that a good friend gave me ;)  How to explain the purpose of the LHC in rap style ! Like we say in French: *Tout un poÃªme* !

The fun part now is to see so many concerns that the LHC will trigger the end of the world. It's funny but it's sad to see a so bad knowledge of science and particularly nuclear physics.

    Thank you Didier ;)
