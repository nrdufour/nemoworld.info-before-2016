title: open-aero.org is now open
---

At last !  I have found the time to finish the first step of this project. At least, a first version (0.1 except the mail activation oops !) is online.

The goal is to federate open source aeronautical projects and therefore offer to anyone an accurate list of projects in this domain.

I will add new features soon (perhaps this weekend or next week).  Keep in touch !  The address -&gt; <a href="http://www.open-aero.org/">http://www.open-aero.org/</a>

<blockquote><strong>Update</strong> (2008/08/29): open-aero.org doesn't exist anymore but will be back soon in open-aero.info ;)</blockquote>
