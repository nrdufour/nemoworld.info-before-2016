title: Adirondak - Day 1
---

So yesterday, after a good night of sleep, we did several bike tours around the Mirror Lake (yes it's a tiny lake so...) and got a map of the region (to see the hiking trails).

We ended up during the evening in a very good (this time) restaurant: [Great Adirondack Steackhouse &amp; Seafood](http://www.greatadirondacksteakandseafood.com/). I never ate a so good prime rib steak honnestly. It was serve like I asked (medium rare) with a smal container with gravy inside and a good baked potatoe. Friend meat lover, go there!

The rain pushed us back to the hotel at the end of the day...

Ok today, we are going to climb Wright Mountain in the south of Lake Placid. The last review I saw said 6.2hours round trip and close to 2500ft difference. The backpacks are ready.

See you
