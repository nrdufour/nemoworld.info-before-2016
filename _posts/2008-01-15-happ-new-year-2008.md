Happy New Year / Bonne Année 2008

I hope this new year will bring you lots of good stuff (health, happiness, joy, love … yup very important ;) ).

Another year in the big universe... Same resolution for that year: trying to post more often ;)

Oh well... specially to post stuff useful such as tricks I found myself that could save time for others ! That’s something that blogs and Google (or other search engines) provide the best. So thank you all.

So see you soon

Nicolas
