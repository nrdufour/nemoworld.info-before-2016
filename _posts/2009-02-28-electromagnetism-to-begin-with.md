title: Electromagnetism to begin with
---

I have been following an excellent course on my iPod in the train about Electromagnetism. The [courseware](http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Physics/8-02Electricity-and-MagnetismSpring2002/VideoAndCaptions/index.htm "Electricity and Magnetism") published by MIT is performed by the brilliant [Walter Lewin](http://web.mit.edu/physics/facultyandstaff/faculty/walter_lewin.html "Walter Lewin's Page") during 36 memorable lectures.

I'm still finishing following course #29 but since course #22 I can be happy to master and understand Maxwell's Equations: 

[![Maxwell Equations](http://www.physics.udel.edu/~watson/phys208/formulas/maxwell.gif "Maxwell Equations")](http://www.physics.udel.edu/~watson/phys208/formulas/maxwell.gif) 

It was a great pleasure to follow that course. Mr Lewin structures each course the same way:

1. Present one or two new concepts
1. Explore the consequences and possible mathematical/physical paths to follow
1. Demonstrate it with one or several experiences

It's a lot of fun and you learn quickly to integrate complex notions with some work on the side (other than just watching the video in the train...)

Here is the lecture #22 which concludes the first part:

MIT offers lots of very interesting free courseware, and I encourage you to look at the [full list](http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/web/courses/courses/index.htm "MIT Courseware List").

**Next one**: Quantum Mecanic by Leonard Susking from the Stanford University (also on iTunesU !).
