title: Lean & Simple
---

After a small but not really conclusive test with more javascript driven pages, I changed the site to be more lean and simple.

Mostly inspired by the excellent site from Paul Davis [http://davispj.com/](http://davispj.com/). I made sure every page is readable by a simple call to `curl`.

The body is still written in [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and the whole page rendered with [mustache](http://mustache.github.com/).

Next steps would be:

+ page support
+ project support
+ a way to gather data from outside

I guess it's time to post about:

+ the wireless sensor project
+ some help on alfresco

Stay tuned.
