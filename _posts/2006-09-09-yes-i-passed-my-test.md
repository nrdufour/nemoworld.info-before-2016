title: Yes! I passed my test!
---

Ok ! This time I got my test !

I was excited like a young student for its graduation :D We were late to the DMV (closing at 4.30pm and arrived at 4.23pm) but the officer let me pass the test.

I did 10 false ! Just the maximum authorised to get it and counting my errors during the test. Oh well. That’s “funny” to have to do that 12 years after my driving exam in France.

Now, I need to get my French driving license translated by an official translator (yes yes paperwork …), come back to the DMV again and I should get my New Jersey License !

What was interesting by studying the driving guide is the fact that two major concerns were largely developed : about kids and alcohol ! For kids, it was all the attention about their place in the car (I imagine that a lot of accidents involved kids in the past). About alcohol, it's simple : don’t drink and drive. It seems so obvious but it’s true that there is so much problem of alcohol and driving in this country that the laws reflect clearly the problem.

The biggest problem comes from the young drivers at college and drinking [beer](http://web.archive.org/web/20070209063557/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/08/01/health/webmd/main1857447.shtml) like a pig and then driving … You can see easily what is next ! It’s interesting to see that the fatalities in accident in USA an roughly constant since 1982 (~42000) but the percentage related to alcohol is dropping from 60 to 39 ([source](http://web.archive.org/web/20070209063557/http://http//www.alcoholalert.com/drunk-driving-statistics.html)).

The source of those numbers can easily be seen on the road with the behavior of the drivers (specially in NJ, in Vermont they are pretty easy ^^). Reckless driving is clearly a major concern as well a great source of accident.

Well, I have to be carefull on the road to not increase rapidly my insurance bill (yes for them I’m considered as a young driver for 3 years!!!!) and be in one piece ;)
