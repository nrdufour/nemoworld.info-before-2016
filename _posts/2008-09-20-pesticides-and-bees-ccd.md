title: Pesticides and bee's CCD
---

I recently read an article about a study made by a team of researchers from Penn State University showing that beeswax and bees are contaminated by pesticides with a maximum of 31 of them!

It seems you have here a kind of combination of multiple molecules creating a highly toxic compound.  As usual in biology, the cause of a problem is rarely coming from one factor but from multiple.

Of course, this study doesn't prove that combination is the cause of CCD but it certainly contribute. They want know study the difference of organic vs non-organic bee keeper.
