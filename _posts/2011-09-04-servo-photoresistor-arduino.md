title: How to couple a servo to a photo-resistor on an Arduino board
---

After using the great examples provided in the Arduino kit, I decided to create my own circuit (nothing very fancy) by combining 2 examples and see if it's going to work.

So I first draw the schema:

![servo photo-resistor schema](/post/servo-photoresistor-arduino/media/servo_photoresistor2_schem.png)

Components:

 - 10k ohms resistor (R1)
 - photo-resistor (LDR)
 - Servo motor (Servo)
 - Arduino UNO or alike

Then tested it. And it worked the first time :)

Pretty nice to see the servo moving when the light goes down or up.

Here is the code I'm using:

    #include <Servo.h>    
    Servo myservo;
    int pos = 0;
    int lightPin = 0;
    
    void setup() {
      // attach the pin 9 to the servo
      myservo.attach(9);
    }
    
    void loop() {
      // read the current voltage at lightPin (0) 
      int lightLevel = analogRead(lightPin); 
      
      // make sure to constrain the value from 0 to 360 
      // this analog pin has 1024 values (10 bits)
      lightLevel = map(lightLevel, 0, 1023, 0, 359);
      pos = constrain(lightLevel, 0, 359);
      
      // finally set the servo angle
      myservo.write(pos);
      delay(100);
    }

I guess now it's time to create something more complex! :-)

**Update - 2011/09/07**:

I'm adding also the breadboard view made with [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/):

I have also fixed the source to take account that the analog pin is encoded with 10 bits and therefore goes from 0 to 1023.

The resistance R1 is actually 10k ohms and not 330 ... sorry about that.
