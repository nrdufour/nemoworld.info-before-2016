Yes, it’s a sad day. The congress voted a new law about the so-called notion of “illegal enemy combatant” (which is already a pure stupidity as if USA was in war state .. yeah right) and how justice must be done for them... Now, anyone who provide “material support” (can be anything then) to terrorists or “illegal enemy combatant” can be judge by a new kind of military trial without knowing what are the charges!

You have understood that the perfect tool for a tyrant to crush anyone which doesn't agree with him. Moreover, you will be trial by the army but you can be tortured for any reason !!!

The Bush administration said the Geneva Conventions are respected, but all I have to say is : Bullshit ! Let’s hope the supreme court will say something (specially with 3 Bush followers inside it) and/or change/cancel this felony to the US constitution and its fathers.

I’m sure Jefferson would be shocked right now...
