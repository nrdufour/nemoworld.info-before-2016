title: Moving to Wordpress
---

Yup ! It happends again !

It seems I search my way for the website … But you know I have a website since 1995. It changes several times of address, title, format , and so on … and still here ;)

My first one was at the university of Paris (Jussieu) and using an old SPARC 10 as the host ! All written in pure html. And almost no image. It was possible to put your email address without fear of spam or other stupidities. Now, I’m using Wordpress as the main engine of my website. Several reasons :
<ul>
 	<li>I was using drupal (which is a wonderful CMS) and in fact, used really only a portion of it.</li>
 	<li>My main content was news and images and links to my projects which are hosted elsewhere</li>
 	<li>Wordpress presents news simply and with a url easy to read and not a serie of numbers !</li>
 	<li>For fun ;)</li>
</ul>

So, let’s continue this way and see you around.
