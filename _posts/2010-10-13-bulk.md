A few interesting articles that I collected recently:

* A German team unveils a [self-driving car](http://www.physorg.com/news/2010-10-self-driving-car-unveiled-germany.html "Self-driving made in germany") \[en\]: a truly autonomous car and also a reminder to the question: why do we still own a car when it's parked most of its time?!
* A very interesting article from the BBC showing how [privacy is being killed by profits](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-11524041 "Profits killing our privacy") \[en\]. It's time we reclaim our privacy! (encryption, direct exchange, etc)
* "Sharing IS legitimate" tells this great [post](http://paigrain.debatpublic.net/?p=1766 "Sharing IS legitimate.") \[en\]. I had no doubt about that. Just that IP holders don't want to loose their business...
* A study reveals [people behavior on password use](http://www.securityweek.com/survey-reveals-how-stupid-people-are-their-passwords "People behavior on password use.") \[en\] ... well it's not pretty. Perhaps it's time to read carefully the great [article on password strength](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_strength "Password Strength")
