I use Alfresco fairly often at work, and it’s rather difficult to find reliable information about it (except on the excellent wiki).

+ [Installation](alfresco-installation): some raw notes on that for now
+ [Backup/Restore](alfresco-backup): often forgotten until it’s too late
+ [Rules](rules): rules are simple triggers acting on contents stored in alfresco
+ [Import](import): how to import quickly *and* reliably data
