Yes, they have been around for a few days since we've given to the angora one a big chunk of grilled salmon!

It seems like 2 siblings and still a lot scared by any human presence.

This morning we had only milk to offer and they ate 4 plates of it! Hungry they are!  Perhaps, we'll catch them as pets ;)
