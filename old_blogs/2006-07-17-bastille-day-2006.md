title: Bastille Day 2006
---

Yes, we were at the bal of Bastille day organised by French Tuesdays and it was a real mess and a big disappointment. The sound was so loud that our ears were like in cotton until the day after !

I was really angry because of this sound level and the fact it was a waste of money and time.

Hopefully, the street fair organised the Sunday at 60th street was a real pleasure :) Lots of French attitude and good food and joy ! Really fun !

So : vive la France :)
