title: First day in Charlevoix
---

Yes, we have left Montreal to visit this beautiful valley. We are staying in a motel pretty simple but decent and clean at Saint Anne de Beaupr√©, close of the church where the remains of Saint Anne are kept (an arm !!).

It seems a very important site for pilgrims, something similar to Lourdes with less people.

We arrived yesterday, and already this night our bikes where on the road until Saint Joachim via the voie royal.
