title: I failed the DMV basic test...
---

Damn ! Bad day today...

I was at the DMV to get my driving license (cause my French doesn't apply here...). First, at Springfield, they just donâ€™t know what to answer to me (if even they want to work !). And now at Elisabeth, I failed the basic test...

I feel humiliated to have to pass those kind of test at my age and failed like that...

Oh well ! I have to study the book and learn it word by word almost...

Well just a bad day...
