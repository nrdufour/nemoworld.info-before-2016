title: Nemoworld is back

Ok I have chosen the wrong hosting company it seems...

Dedimove was a reseller of dedibox machines. It seems they got in trouble with Dedibox company and since then no access to my server and of course I have only an old backup of my blog...

Well, perhaps it's time to start from scratch... again.

Anyway, this time I need a regular backup or close to that.

See you soon
