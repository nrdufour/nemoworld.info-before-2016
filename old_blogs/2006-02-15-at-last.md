At last !

We just got back from the immigration building, my wife and I, where we had an interview with an USA immigration officer to discuss about my green card after our wedding !

We were very neveous and the lawyer did show up one hour late ! But the interview was better than I expected :  She asked each of us about informations about the other :

*what is his birthday ? Do you know where she work ?* and so on. Questions checked by the file she had (the officer). In fact, it seems that after seeing our wedding pictures (she kept all of them !) and our health insurance policy where our names are in it, she just check us on usual questions.

Like said the lawyer : our case was the easiest one he got ;) .

But anyway, it was lots of stress (you never know what the gov can do against you …) and lots of wait time and papers to fill up.

So if your are in the same situation than us (marrying a us citizen) dont waste your time and take immediatly a lawyer : it’s a great help specially to fill up the right forms and in the right time (he was late this morning, but after all our case is done so …)

Anyway, that means I have now the same right than any american citizen (except to vote or be elected i think). It’s a great relief and we can go on now :)

Thanks to all of you who help us (friends, work relationships and so on) for your support !
