title: House Hunting
---

We have started to house hunt this past Saturday.

After seeing 12 houses (some were canceled by just passing by...), 2 just stayed in our mind. One was very spacious and a bug backyard but very close to the highway... and the second one, very cute looking, a bit small and lots to repair.

We almost bought that last one, but finally keep looking for a better opportunity. This house was too small anyway and too many problems vs cuteness/location.

So, it’s just a start. It’s our first time so we are pretty green to that kind of task, bu we are learning fast!

To be continued...

> **Update** (2008/08/29): We finally bought a house and closed end of April. Since then it's lot of work to do as well, but lots of joy :)
