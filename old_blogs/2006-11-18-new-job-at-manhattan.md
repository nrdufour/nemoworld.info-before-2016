title: New job at Manhattan
---

Yes ! Iâ€™ve been searching for a new job since October 26th and in 3 weeks I got a good position in the south tip of Manhattan (at the 22nd floor with a gorgeous view !).

I closed my contract with my previous French company (7 years) and move on toward new adventures.

I will have to take the train and the subway to reach the office and I will be able to enjoy this marvellous city as well ! Starting next Monday, and I will meet the whole team and perhaps a little cocktail to celebrate.

A new step in my integration of my American life here in New Jersey ! Oh yes and I got recently my driving license at the DMV (at last). I was able this time to provide a good translation of my French driving license and they granted me.

So, now I have to work hard and prove to my new employee that I was their best choice as well ;)

And thank you for all the persons who gave me good advices and informations for this new step.
