Here we are!

We got to the place (The Mountain View Inn) in about 6h through the interstate 87. And this inn is in pretty good shape and good location.

First thing, you can smell and feel the difference in the air here. It's cooler, less humid and a smell of pine comes from time to time.

After putting suitcases and bikes, we got a small visit of the town and finally got to a restaurant called "Firestone"... Well don't go there seriously. It's really not good at all.

Now, this morning after a quick breakfast in the motel (coffee and fruits), let's go biking around Mirror Lake :)

See ya
