Vacation time is over, and after a long drive through Quebec and Vermont, we’re back to Home Sweet Home.

My wife published recently our pictures :) –> [here](http://gallery.completecomputing.com/userpublic/denise/charlevoix/).

It was a good time for hiking, bicycling everywhere (at least 20 miles a day), kayaking, eating delicious meals (mmmmmmm), finding nice rocks to bring back, trying to sleep with the noise of the trucks and watching those beautiful whales ! Well, a pretty good time !
