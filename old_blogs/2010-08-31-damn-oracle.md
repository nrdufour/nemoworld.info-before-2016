Just a little excerpt from IRC about Java and Oracle:

{% highlight irc %}

    <RSchulz2> "Thank you for installing the  Java Development Kit Version 7  from Oracle Corporation. "
    <CapNemo> "from Oracle corporation" .... is it just me or it gives a nasty back taste !
    <pantsman> like reading a bedtime story to your kids and then finding out it was written by a paedophile

{% endhighlight %}

I would say no more ;)
