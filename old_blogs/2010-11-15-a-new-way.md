Alright! I finally made the jump! **The CouchDB way**!

This blog is now running with:

* [CouchDB](http://www.couchdb.org)
* my own [couchapp](http://www.couchapp.org)
* [nginx](http://www.nginx.org) (hosted on a linux box).

It was fairly easy to do it (except a few issues with the URLs still...) and Futon is enough to edit posts (except that you have to be careful when you edit a field, hum).

I'm going to extend this couchapp and add more in order to be able to do more than just a stupid blog (perhaps too many on this planet ;) ) and collect and share data. I have put the server into a dedicated URL: [https://io.nemoworld.info](https://io.nemoworld.info/_utils) in order to just do that.

I will put the couchapp code on a github repository later on. Now it's more time to experiment and see what I can do.

*Let's see where this new way leads!*
