title: First day at Montreal
---

Yipeeee first day of vacation ! :)

After a good drive with our bikes in the back of the car from New York to Montreal, we arrived in this hotel near the Vieux Port.

A good advice : don't go to this hotel (Travelodge at Montreal) … simply don't !

We paid $109/day for a shoe box good enough for one (we are two), the bathroom is not working (the toilet is simply plugged !) to finish in beauty, the AC stop at 76F (24C) making the night difficult. grrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

So Montreal is a great city but it’s a bad start … at least we found a charming place at Beaupré (near Quebec) for Saturday !

> **Update:** Ok, once they understood that everything was not working, they gave us a new room (in front of previous one), curiously much more cleaner and this time with no problem ! at last !
