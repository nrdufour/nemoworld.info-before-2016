title: Let's explore the countryside of Charlevoix

After few days at Saint Anne de Beaupré : beautiful church with decorations and geometric patterns coming from the local Indians tribes (tons and tons of mosaics, really marvellous), we are going to go to Baie Saint Paul much more north. It’s still next the Saint Laurent river and much colder.

We should have the time to see the whales and belugas in the bay with the "Croisieres Dufour" ;) Also, see the parks around, enjoy the landscape in bicycle !

Well no Internet for at least 6 days .. so see you soon.
