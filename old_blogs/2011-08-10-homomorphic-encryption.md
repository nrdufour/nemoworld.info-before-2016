title: Homomorphic Encryption
---

I recently rediscover this fascinating property many math systems have: homomorphism.

Specially when it's applied to an encryption system, it becomes even more fascinating: the way to compute with encrypted data without having the need to decrypt them!

Making a very robust encryption system is already hard, making it homomorphic even so. Many systems are partially homomorphic like supporting just addition or just multiplication. Only two systems are known to have both really be usable (see [Homomorphic Encryption](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption)).

Anyway, it's clearly something to follow because it might change dragstically how we use the famous cloud services...

[Here](http://www.technologyreview.com/computing/37197/) is a good article explaining how it works.
